## SORT

#### Project Goal

To Sort a numbers array or string or Linked list using Buble Sort

#### How To Run

##### 1. Install Dependencies

`npm i
`

##### 2. Run Development Server

`npm run dev
`

##### 3. Run Production Server

`npm start
`

#### Notes For Dev

##### Script Setup Process

Using Nodemon for development server to monitoring changes and refreshing
Standard Script commands defined in package.json
Specifying tsc config for build by changing tsCongif.json ( set up using tsc --init )

##### V1 ISSUES

Sorter needs to have type guards and change sort fn according to that
